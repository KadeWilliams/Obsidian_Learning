# 1.0 Building Abstractions with Functions
*Computational processes* are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called *data*. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a *program*.

A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately.
